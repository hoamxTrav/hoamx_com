            <h3>Bad Property Management Is a Liability</h3>
            <p>
              Why “set and forget” management is dangerous. This piece walks through
              red flags like poor communication, late payments, hidden fees, lack of
              inspections, and legal exposure when tenant rights are violated.

              It argues that owners are ultimately responsible for breaches of
              fair housing laws, hazardous conditions, and mishandled deposits,
              and stresses the importance of documentation if you need to correct
              or terminate a management contract.

              This article outlines the realities of maintaining property, 
              responding 24/7 to emergencies, managing rising costs, and dealing

              It frames rental ownership as an actual business: owners must balance ROI with safety,

              A deep dive into what “scaling” actually means: not just adding more
              doors, but building efficient, standardized processes, automation,
              and financial planning so growth doesn’t break the system.

            <h3>Four Keys to Successfully Scaling a Property Management Company</h3>
            <p>
              Centered on an interview with a CEO who scaled to thousands of units,
              this article highlights four keys: SEO and digital marketing, constant
              process review, hiring the right people, and investing in legal and
              compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The growth story shows how disciplined marketing, detailed handbooks,
              and clearly defined roles turn chaotic growth into a repeatable,
              scalable operation.

          <article class="card">
            <h3>19 Common Challenges When Trying to Scale Operations</h3>
            <p>
              A broader business article that applies directly to property and HOA
              management: growing too fast, strained culture, declining quality,
              stagnant leadership, misaligned focus, and fragmented tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              The recurring theme is that scaling fails when leaders neglect systems,
              standards, communication, and unified data — exactly the gaps HOA-MX
              is designed to close.
