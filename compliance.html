          HOAMX is designed around Minnesota common interest community law: 
          clear notices, documented decisions, and durable records. The 
          platform does the organizing work so your board can focus on 
          judgment calls, not paperwork.

            <p>
              HOAMX is structured around Minnesota’s common interest community
              framework, including financial reporting, notice rules, and
              evolving reforms such as Senate File 1750.

              in Telegram, the Document Vault, or the reporting layer for 
              future references. They can also be set to private status.

          While every association’s documents are unique, most Minnesota HOAs
          share a few core compliance obligations. HOAMX is built to support
          those patterns without giving legal advice.

        <h2>How HOAMX supports compliance</h2>
        <p class="section-lead">
          Compliance isn’t a separate module in HOAMX; it’s built into the 
          core features: billing, communications, governance, documents, and reports.
        </p>

        <div class="cards-grid">
          <article class="card">
            <h3>Billing &amp; Payments</h3>
            <p>
              Billing keeps a complete, unit-level ledger of dues, assessments, 
              and fines, along with the dates they were applied and any related 
              notes or documents. Late-fee rules can be configured to comply with 
              board policy that reflects Minnesota's limits on fines and fees.

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Telegram Communications Archive</h3>
            <p>
              Telegram centralizes letters, email, voicemail, SMS, and AI chat
              into a searchable log. Each entry can be tagged to a unit,
              violation, motion, or claim, creating a verifiable trail of how
              the board communicated and when.
            </p>
            <p>
              This supports notice requirements and makes it easier to show
              what was said if a disagreement escalates.

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Board Governance</h3>
            <p>
              Motions, votes, and meetings can be recorded with links to
              Telegram threads and documents. “Meet and confer” conversations
              or policy decisions can be tagged so the board can show it
              followed a consistent process in response to issues.

              The Document Vault stores bylaws, rules, insurance policies,
              budgets, and key resolutions in a categorized, permanent archive.
              Documents can be linked to the meetings and communications that

              helps ensure communication reaches the right parties, with 
              call routing and voicemail transcription for boards that opt

              formal audits. Exported reports and bundled documents help
              demonstrate that the board is following its financial and

          HOAMX is built to make that work easier by providing clean records,
