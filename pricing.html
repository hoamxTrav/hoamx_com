          HOAMX is designed to be adopted in stages. Bronze is the minimum required
          service level, Silver mirrors traditional full-service management, and Gold
          adds advanced communications and AI intelligence as your community’s needs
          grow.

              Minimum required services. For boards that want clear records, compliant
              notices, billing, and simple communication tracking while keeping most
              tasks in-house.

              plus day-to-day operational support handling calls, billing, maintenance
              coordination, and standard reporting.

              summaries, and analytics layered on top.

          Each tier builds on the previous one. Bronze is the minimum platform and
          record-keeping layer. Silver adds traditional operational support. Gold layers
          in advanced communications and AI-assisted workflows.

          <!-- BRONZE -->
          <article class="card">
            <h3>Bronze</h3>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Core Records, Billing &amp; Compliance</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Best for:</strong> Smaller or self-managed boards that want the
              minimum required services: clear records, reliable billing, and clean
              documentation without fully outsourcing management.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Telegram communications archive (mail, email, voicemail, SMS)</li>
              <li>Document Vault for bylaws, budgets, and insurance</li>
              <li>Board Governance basics (motions, meetings, minutes)</li>
              <li>Core Directory for residents, board, and vendors</li>
              <li>Billing &amp; Payments (dues, assessments, late fees)</li>
              <li>Standard Reports &amp; Audits (annual summary exports)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Outcome:</strong> A clean, searchable history of decisions,
              notices, and financials that supports board continuity and Minnesota CIC
              record-keeping expectations — the minimum HOAMX service level for any
              association.

          </article>

          <!-- SILVER -->
          <article class="card">
            <h3>Silver</h3>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Traditional Full-Service Management</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Best for:</strong> Boards that want HOAMX plus a traditional
              management experience: someone to answer phones, process payments, triage
              maintenance, and prepare routine reports.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Everything in <strong>Bronze</strong>, plus:</li>
              <li>Maintenance &amp; Work Orders (resident → manager → vendor)</li>
              <li>Enhanced Directory &amp; Contact Center with call routing &amp; voicemail</li>
              <li>Monthly financial reporting and reconciled ledgers</li>
              <li>Standard vendor coordination (landscape, snow, basic maintenance)</li>
              <li>More detailed reports (payments, delinquencies, maintenance spend)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Outcome:</strong> Fewer lost messages, clearer workflows, and a
              single system where residents, vendors, and the board interact without
              the board carrying all the day-to-day workload.

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Gold</h3>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Advanced Communications &amp; AI Intelligence</p>

              <strong>Best for:</strong> Associations that want the HOAMX platform,
              full operational support, and enhanced communication and insight tools:
              summaries, analytics, and AI-assisted drafting and tracking.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Everything in <strong>Silver</strong>, plus:</li>
              <li>Advanced Telegram tools (AI summaries of threads &amp; meetings)</li>
              <li>Automated meeting minutes and board packet generation</li>
              <li>Pattern detection in maintenance and spending over time</li>
              <li>Enhanced reporting and analytics for reserves &amp; operations</li>
              <li>Optional reserve investment coordination through approved partners</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Outcome:</strong> A digital-first management model where the
              board stays in control, repetitive work is automated, and complex topics
              (projects, disputes, budgets) are easier to understand and explain.
