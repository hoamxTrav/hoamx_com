          compliance and documentation, and grow into a full operations and
          professional-services stack as your community needs evolve.

      <section class="section">
        <h2>How pricing is scoped</h2>
        <p class="section-lead">
          HOA-MX pricing is based on a few simple factors: number of units, number
          of active vendors, and whether you need software only or software plus
          annual services. No per-resident logins and no surprise fees.
        </p>

          <div class="info-block">
            <h3>1. Understand your community</h3>
            <p>
              We look at unit count, number of board/manager users, and the mix of
              vendors (landscape, snow, maintenance, insurance, legal).
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-block">
            <h3>2. Choose your tier</h3>
            <p>
              Decide whether Minimal, Basic, or Premium best fits your current
              needs. You can always move up as your board’s workload changes.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-block">
            <h3>3. Add services if needed</h3>
            <p>
              Attach accounting, legal, insurance, or training services as add-ons.
              Each service is quoted per association, not per user.
