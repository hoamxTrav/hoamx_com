            <h3>1. Connect your board</h3>
            <p>
              We set up your HOA in HOAMX with roles for board members, managers, and
              vendors. No app install required—just email, web, and phone.

              Letters, emails, voicemails, and texts all feed into Telegram, your unified
              communication log. Every decision has a paper trail.

              to day, with reports ready for audits and annual meetings.
